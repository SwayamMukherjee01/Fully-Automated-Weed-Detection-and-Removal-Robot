# Fully-Automated-Weed-Detection-and-Removal-Robot
Developed a Fully Automated Weed Detection and Removal Robot designed to tackle one of agriculture’s biggest challenges—efficient and sustainable weed management. The system combines a tank-steered autonomous rover, a 4-DOF robotic arm, and a real-time vision module to detect and remove weeds without the use of chemical herbicides. Using HSV color-based image processing, the robot distinguishes weeds from crops, generates precise coordinates, and performs targeted mechanical extraction.

The rover follows a parallel-line navigation pattern, pauses at intervals for analysis, and uses obstacle detection to safely move through fields. Key components include a high-resolution camera, Arduino-based control architecture, a modular arm mechanism, and a dual-battery power system. Analytical, simulation, and field tests demonstrated over 85–90% detection accuracy, ±3 cm coordinate precision, an 80% weed extraction success rate, and 20% reduced energy consumption.

The project emphasizes sustainability by minimizing herbicide use, lowering labor dependency, and offering a scalable solution for precision agriculture. With future potential in GPS navigation, solar-powered operation, and improved ML-based detection, this autonomous robot showcases a practical and affordable step toward smart farming technologies.
